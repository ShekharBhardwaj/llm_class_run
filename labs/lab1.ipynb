    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Why This Structure?\n",
    "OpenAI designed this message format to **simulate conversations** more naturally and **make interactions flexible and organized**. By breaking messages into different \"roles,\" it’s easier for the model to understand instructions, follow context, and respond appropriately. Plus, it's easier for developers to build complex systems where the AI might need to switch between different tasks or personalities. 🎭\n",
