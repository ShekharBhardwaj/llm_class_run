    "- Move **beyond Pipelines** and into **lower-level APIs**!\n",

    "## ðŸ§  What is a Tokenizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Tokenizer** converts **text** into **tokens** (numbers!) and back.\n",
    "- Think of it as a **text shredder and builder**:\n",
    "  - **Encode**: `\"Hello!\"` âž” `[1542, 312, 29]`\n",
    "  - **Decode**: `[1542, 312, 29]` âž” `\"Hello!\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Every model needs a tokenizer to work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Each model usually has its **own tokenizer** (because they were trained together).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¥ Special Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some tokens have **special meanings** like:\n",
    "  - `<start>` âž” Beginning of a sentence\n",
    "  - `<user>` âž” Start of a user message\n",
    "  - `<assistant>` âž” Start of an assistant response\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Models **learn** what these tokens mean by seeing them during training â€”  \n",
    "there's no magic, just lots of examples!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’¬ What is a Chat Template?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's a **recipe** for turning multi-turn conversations into a single token list.\n",
    "- E.g., combining system, user, and assistant messages into one long stream of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Hugging Face tokenizers for chat models (like LLaMA, Phi, Qwen) use templates.\n",
