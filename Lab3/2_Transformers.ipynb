    "\n",
    "## ✨ Simple Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "**RLHF** is a method where AI models (like ChatGPT)  \n",
    "are **trained not just to predict text**,  \n",
    "but to **behave in ways that humans actually prefer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 How It Works (In Simple Steps):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train a Basic Model First**  \n",
    "   - First, a big model (like GPT) is trained the usual way — by predicting the next word from lots of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect Human Feedback**  \n",
    "   - Humans **rate** or **choose** between different AI outputs.\n",
    "   - Example:  \n",
    "     > \"Which answer sounds more polite/helpful/correct?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train a Reward Model**  \n",
    "   - A small model learns **how to predict human preferences** based on this feedback.\n",
    "   - (Kind of like teaching the AI **what humans like**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  \n",
    "   - Now, the big AI model **tries to maximize the score** given by the reward model.\n",
    "   - It learns **to write or answer** in ways that get **higher scores** (i.e., more aligned with humans).\n",
