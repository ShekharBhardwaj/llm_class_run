    "## 🚧 Limitations of Frontier Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the most advanced Frontier Models have their kryptonite. Here’s where they still struggle—and where they’re rapidly closing the gap. ⚖️\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔒 Specialized Domains  \n",
    "Frontier Models excel at general knowledge, but they can stumble in highly specialized fields like cutting-edge medical research, niche legal frameworks, or obscure technical topics. 🧬⚖️  \n",
    "*Progress:* Models are improving through fine-tuning and custom training, but true mastery over niche domains remains a work in progress. 📈  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 📅 Recent Events  \n",
    "AI models are trained on vast datasets, but they can’t access real-time information. Anything that happened after their last training cut-off is a mystery. 🌍⏳  \n",
    "*Progress:* Integration with live data sources and continuous training is making them more current, but it’s still not perfect. 🔄  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 😅 Confidently Making Mistakes (Curious Blindspots)  \n",
    "Sometimes, AI models produce outputs that sound incredibly convincing but are just plain wrong. They can confidently generate errors or overlook important details. 🤖💡❌  \n",
    "*Progress:* Developers are working on techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to reduce these embarrassing moments. 🛠️  \n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations are shrinking fast as researchers improve models through fine-tuning, real-time updates, and better alignment techniques. The gap between what AI can do and what we need it to do is getting narrower every day. 📉✨  \n"
